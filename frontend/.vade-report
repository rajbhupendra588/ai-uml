# Vercel Speed Insights Installation and Configuration

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Integration in Root Layout
Modified `app/layout.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";`
- Inserted `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<ThemeProvider>` closing tag
- The component is correctly placed at the root level to track all page navigations

## Implementation Details

**Next.js Version**: 16.1.6 (well above 13.5)
**Router Type**: App Router
**Package Manager**: npm

Since this project uses Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router, I followed the recommended approach:
- Imported `SpeedInsights` from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Added the component directly to the root layout without needing the `usePathname()` hook
- No "use client" directive needed as the SpeedInsights component handles client-side behavior internally

## Verification

✅ **Linter**: No new errors introduced (pre-existing warnings remain)
✅ **Build**: Successfully compiled with `npm run build`
✅ **TypeScript**: Type-checking passed during build
✅ **Tests**: No test suite configured in the project

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights component and import
2. `frontend/package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
3. `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with new package information

The Speed Insights component will now automatically track page views and Web Vitals metrics when the application is deployed to Vercel.
